### **knowledgeRelay: AI-based Knowledge Transfer Agent**

Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to mitigate project knowledge loss and streamline new member onboarding. The agent facilitates interactive knowledge transfer from outgoing members and provides project-specific answers to incoming team members with source attribution.

* **Knowledge Ingestion:**
    * Designed and implemented a multi-method knowledge base enrichment pipeline utilizing a vector database.
    * Engineered a two-step QA process:
        * **Project Global QA:** An LLM generates adaptive questions based on chat history to build a comprehensive, project-wide knowledge base.
        * **Document QA:** The agent generates targeted questions from uploaded documents, and user responses enrich the knowledge store.
    * Architected a preprocessing pipeline for raw documents, including:
        * Intelligent text splitting with overlapping chunks for context retention.
        * Specialized chunking strategies for both code and natural language text.
        * Text cleaning to remove emojis, non-ASCII characters, and excessive whitespace.
    * Utilized ChromaDB to store vector embeddings and rich metadata, enabling fine-grained, filtered retrieval.

* **Knowledge Retrieval:**
    * Built a RAG-based query-answering mechanism that retrieves relevant knowledge from the vector store.
    * Implemented a `contextualize_qa_chain` to dynamically rephrase user queries based on conversation history, significantly improving search precision and retrieval accuracy.
    * Contextualized answers are generated by the LLM using retrieved documents, ensuring responses are grounded and verifiable with attached sources.

* **Technologies:** Python, LangChain, FastAPI, ChromaDB, LLMs (OpenAI, Ollama), React.
